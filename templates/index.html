    "Spend the years of learning squandering<br>
    Courage for the years of wandering<br>
    Through a world politely turning<br>
    From the loutishness of learning."

    <br><br>
    Full many a gem of purest ray serene<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear;<br>
    Full many a flower is born to blush unseen<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And waste its sweetness on the air.<br>
